What is the most precious resource in the world? Is it oil? Gold? Real
estate? I would argue that **time** is the most precious resource in the
world. No matter how rich you are, you can’t buy another hour in a
24-hour day. Instead of trying to find more time, focus on making the
most effective use of the limited time you do have. Your real estate CRM
can help you systematize and organize your day. It can also help you
understand which activities produce results and which do not. Take
advantage of the planning and time management tools in your CRM to
master time and maximize your results. Without a CRM, it is all too easy
for your real estate career to consume your personal time and create
unnecessary stress.

## Habits for Results

A habit is something you do regularly, like brushing your teeth every
morning. We all need repetition to make a habit stick. If you do the
same thing at the same time every day, it becomes part of your routine
and is easier to repeat day after day. By scheduling blocks of time on
your calendar for follow-up calls, you remove the ability to
procrastinate. You can’t build habits for long-term goals, like closing
a deal, but you can create habits that help you complete the individual
tasks you need to close that deal.

One way to build habits you will stick with is to connect them to your
existing routine. This strategy, known as “habit stacking,” involves
pairing a new action with an established one[11].

For example, you likely already have a morning habit of checking your
email. Stack onto that habit another habit of signing in and reviewing
the tasks and appointments in your CRM. By pairing an incremental habit
(checking your CRM) with an existing habit (checking your email), you
make it easier to adopt the new habit as part of your daily routine.


Your calendar will be the fixed points for your day. These are the
appointments you must attend on a specific date and time. Your tasks are
things you need to get done in any order, which means you have more
flexibility with them than with your calendar.

I recommend using **time-blocking** to set aside specific times of your
day for specific activities – like door-knocking, making follow-up phone
calls, printing, and mailing letters. The best way to do that is to
schedule appointments with yourself in your calendar, preferably
repeating appointments. You are building a structured environment where
you spend less time planning and more time doing the activities that
need to be done.

Creating structure in your day will increase your productivity. Have you
ever noticed that when you procrastinate, you spend more time thinking
about procrastinating than it would take to complete the task you are
putting off? Blocking your time for activities eliminates the ability to
procrastinate. This is particularly important for tasks you might not
enjoy doing.

Think of time-blocking as commitments you make to yourself to achieve
something during that block of time. A common myth is that real estate
agents have no boss and can show up and work whenever it suits them. A
successful agent is their own boss and schedules their time to increase
their chances of making money. They build habits of doing the same thing
at the same time every day, such as making outgoing phone calls for 2
hours every morning between 9 and 11 am. The agent who keeps a schedule
will be less stressed and earn a higher income than an agent who does
not block their time. The repetition and regularity of these time blocks
create muscle memory that helps you perform better at your job.

Your time-blocking should include personal time as well. If you have a
family, block out time for them. Work-life balance is challenging for
real estate agents because demands on their time often make it difficult
to spend quality time with their families. So, you will need to
compensate. The best times to reach clients are typically around dinner
hour, so you may miss a few family dinners. You will likely be working
weekends as well. However, you do have available time that a 9-5 job
does not. Get up early and make breakfast for everyone. If you have
grade school-age kids, volunteer at the school. Meet your kids for
lunch. Volunteer to coach sports and do other activities
opportunistically. Take your spouse out to lunch instead of dinner.

You need time to prepare for your listing presentations, so make sure
you allocate a block of time before each one to put together your
Comparative Market Analysis (CMA), review your presentation and
potential objections, and plan how you will handle them.


> **Morning Map, Evening Wrap Secret**: Sign into your CRM each morning before you start work and each evening before you go to bed. Check your calendar for your hard commitments, as well as your tasks list which are activities which you can handle between appointments. This is your way of holding yourself accountable for making the most of every day. Without a plan, it is too easy to get distracted.


Your time will be in heavy demand at certain times of day and during
certain seasons of the year. For example, you are likely to be busier
during the summer, but you will not be nearly as busy between Christmas
and New Year’s.

One specific block of time you must always prioritize is the time you
spend making outgoing phone calls, which I like to call **office
hours**. It is not enough to just answer the phone when people call you.
You should use your office hours to reach out to people who might not
otherwise contact you. I recommend reserving your office hours for
interactive activities where you expect to reach someone and interact
with them live. Sending an email, updating your website, or posting on
Facebook can be done at other times of the day, such as late evening or
early morning, in between your other activities.

Ideally, you should be in your office during your office hours. Sign in
to your real estate CRM, open your daily call list, and start making
your follow-up calls. Being in the same place at the same time puts you
in the same frame of mind. When you make outgoing calls, you are in
control. You are prepared for the conversation and know what you are
going to say. You are being proactive. It is not the same when someone
calls you with a question about one of your listings while you are
driving. At other times of the day, you can be reactive. You must set
aside time in your day for these proactive calls.

Each agent will determine the best time of day for these outgoing calls.
Typically, these times are in the morning, early afternoon, right after
the kids are back from school, and during the dinner hour. Since your
main goal is to interact with someone in person, you need to find the
best time of day to maximize your chances.

You also need to consider the best way to reach the person you are
trying to contact. Each person is different, and you should take that
into account when deciding how to reach them. Many younger prospects
don’t answer their phones. However, if you send a text message, you
might get a response from the same people within 5 minutes. Retirees are
more likely to be available during the day and to answer their phones.
They are also more likely to still have a landline.

Before making an outgoing call, spend a minute reviewing your notes.
When was the last time you spoke with this person, and what did you
discuss? If you left a voicemail last time, try a text message this
time. If you called in the afternoon and they weren’t available, try
calling in the evening or morning next time. Each prospect is different,
so adapt your approach to each person’s lifestyle.

Many agents rely too heavily on email for prospecting. Email has many
limitations, especially when prospecting people you do not know well.
You can use your real estate CRM to **track who is reading your
emails**. However, getting someone to read your emails is not enough.
They also need to respond by calling you or replying by email. While
email is easy to send, it is not nearly as impactful as other forms of
communication when it comes to getting a response. For this reason, I
recommend using email as a complement to other forms of communication.
Don’t rely on email as your primary form of communication with a new
prospect.

For example, suppose you spoke with someone on the phone who expressed
interest in learning about the tax benefits of owning a home. In that
case, this is an ideal opportunity to send your prospect a time-release
drip sequence of emails about the tax benefits of homeownership. Emails
work exceptionally well when the recipient is expecting them and the
content is something they are interested in.

You should also prioritize interactive forms of communication, such as
phone calls, text messages, and door-knocking, over less interactive
forms like postcards and email. While email has its place, it is less
interactive than these other forms and, therefore, is less likely to
generate the results you are looking for. Your ideal prospecting call
lets you respond to the conversation and pivot quickly based on what is
said. The likelihood of convincing someone to use you as their agent is
far higher when you can use your powers of persuasion.

Gary Keller of Keller Williams recommends a practice he calls the 3-hour
habit. This means spending 3 hours a day on lead generation. Your 3
hours of lead generation might be organized differently from Monday to
Friday, depending on the specific tasks you intend to accomplish and the
time you have available each day.

You should reward yourself after completing challenging tasks. Ideally,
the reward should be immediate, so you associate it with the activity.
For example, a reward for calling 10 people might be a 10-minute walk
around the block. I recommend avoiding food rewards, such as an ice
cream cone, because they can conflict with any weight-loss goals you
might have.

You should set long-term goals and long-term rewards. For example, you
could set a specific annual income goal with a Hawaiian vacation at the
end of the year as the reward. The value of these goals rests on your
absolute belief that you can achieve them. For a goal like this to work,
you need to visualize that Hawaiian sand between your toes. When it is
late, and you are tired, you will think of your goal and know in your
heart that all the hard work is worth it. If you lack confidence that
you can achieve your goal, it won’t work. So, start with smaller goals.
Meet your small goal and earn your small reward. Then, as you gain
confidence, you can extend your goals and increase the size of your
rewards.

## Protecting Your Time

As a real estate professional, you will be required to perform many
tasks, but since your time is limited, every hour spent on one activity
means less time for another. I recommend taking an inventory of your
core skills and the primary way you generate income. If you are
extroverted, your core skills are meeting people and building
relationships. If you are introverted, your skills might lean toward
direct mail, website design, social media, and Search Engine
Optimization (SEO), which is the process of writing content for your
website to attract visitors from search engines like Google. It is rare
for an individual to be equally skilled at everything. Be honest with
yourself about your strengths and weaknesses. Delegate any activity that
someone else can do better and more cheaply. That way, you can focus
your attention on the activities you are uniquely qualified to do, like
converting prospects into clients.


> **The Time Machine Tune-Up Secret**: Log your work in 15-minute intervals for a full week to see how you are spending your time. This is an easy way to reveal inefficiencies which you might be able to eliminate.


A real estate CRM lets you store your forms, paperwork, and contracts in
the cloud so you can access them from anywhere, eliminating unnecessary
trips to the office. I recommend setting up a home office and being
mindful of what you can accomplish in each location, as well as how to
minimize driving time. Combine office activities and do those tasks
together. Most agents spend a lot of time in the car, so one way to be
more efficient is to combine out-of-office activities—like dropping off
a yard sign, key, lockbox, and flyer, and taking pictures—into a single
trip. Use categories in your real estate CRM to group tasks that can be
done together, such as office and field tasks. The most significant time
savings will come from scheduling a regular time on your calendar for
back-office activities, such as making follow-up calls, and using your
CRM’s automation features to work on those tasks quickly, one after the
other.

I also recommend that you set aside a few hours on Fridays to send
birthday cards and thank-you notes.

By front-loading the tasks you dread as the first thing in the morning,
you can get them done sooner. This concept, popularized by author Brian
Tracy in his book "Eat That Frog!", holds that completing the most
challenging task first lets you go through the rest of the day feeling
accomplished and knowing the worst is behind you. With your chores out
of the way, you will feel lighter and happier for the rest of the day.
When you procrastinate on tasks you dislike, you sabotage your
efficiency. Schedule activities you enjoy for later in the day. That
way, when your energy is lower, you can do the things you enjoy.
Ideally, each task on your task list is small enough to accomplish in
under an hour.

If you are feeling overwhelmed, focus on completing several small, quick
tasks one after another. This strategy leverages the psychological boost
of immediate progress, creating a positive feedback loop that makes it
easier to start larger projects[12].

Be careful about distractions. If you are working on your task list and
get distracted by something that comes along, do not switch to that new
activity. Instead, add a new item to your task list and prioritize it.
If you are easily distracted, you might have difficulty completing
tasks. Too many uncompleted tasks create inefficiency. It is to your
advantage to complete one task before switching to the next.

Avoid the trap of perfectionism in everything you do. There will
undoubtedly be important areas of your life where you should be as
perfect as possible. However, there are other aspects of your life where
the extra time spent making something perfect will not generate
additional income and is not worth the added aggravation. Some agents
think they need the perfect letterhead, the perfect website, and so on
before they can even start selling real estate. Don’t overthink it. You
can start with imperfect business cards. Then, in 6 months, when it is
time to reorder cards, you can improve them. The same goes for your
letterhead and your website. Don’t let the pursuit of perfection prevent
you from getting things done.

Not everyone you speak with will want to buy or sell immediately.
Instead, assume your actions may take several months, or even a year or
more, to fully take effect. That is why it is so important to use your
CRM to record your progress. The long-term, durable notes and
information you collect, especially notes from conversations, provide
valuable material for follow-up conversations. For each new person you
meet, make sure you enter how you met them in the referral source field.
That way, when you close a deal with them, you can account for which of
your marketing and sales strategies is responsible for that win.


> **Gratitude Gift Secret**: Track referrals in your CRM and send your top referral sources a holiday gift each year. Proactive gratitude keeps you top-of-mind.


When you start using your CRM, you might be overwhelmed by all the new
capabilities and tempted to spend weeks learning how everything works.
Resist that temptation. I recommend finding a single key feature in your
CRM you can use immediately. You need to deliver tangible results on the
first day. For example, how about calling someone with a birthday this
week to wish them a happy birthday? It seems like a small goal, but you
must start somewhere.

The ideal real estate CRM for a new agent is easy to use yet fully
featured, so you can get started quickly without being overwhelmed. Use
your CRM's task management features to track what you need to do and
mark tasks complete. You should also take notes during conversations so
you have a long-term record of your conversations. When you talk with a
prospect, be sure to schedule your follow-up call before hanging up.

If you feel overwhelmed trying to accomplish a goal, try breaking it
into several smaller goals. Then, give yourself a fixed amount of time
to complete each smaller goal. Ideally, each small goal should be
something you can accomplish in one hour or less. That will give you a
sense of accomplishment and prevent unfinished tasks from hanging over
you.

For example, if you need to create an open house flyer, budget a fixed
amount of time to complete it. Choose a flyer design from your real
estate CRM’s template library. Copy the text from your MLS listing and
add pictures. You can improve the flyer over time, but there’s a lot of
value in creating something quickly using the pre-built templates that
come with your CRM. While you might have been able to create a
marginally better flyer by spending another five hours, that one-hour
flyer is probably good enough.

The more experience you gain, the faster you will complete tasks and the
higher the quality of your results will be. This means the best thing
you can do right now is to gain as much experience as possible. Work
with as many listings and buyers as you can. The more hours you spend
doing your job, the better you will be at it.


> **Flyer in a Flash Secret**: You do not need to be a graphic designer to create professional materials. Use your CRM’s built-in flyer templates to save time and money. A good system includes dozens of designs for common situations. Plug in your photos, property details, and your brand elements. The system generates a polished, print-ready PDF in seconds. This keeps your brand consistent across all listings without opening a design program.


Don’t spend time planning future work you can start immediately. A good
example is making follow-up calls. A common pitfall is scheduling future
calls but never making them. That is a form of procrastination because
you use the time spent planning to delay the actual work of making those
calls.

New agents are often overwhelmed by all the things they need to do to
start as a real estate agent. I recommend taking a step-by-step approach
and building incrementally. For example, one of the first things you
will need is business cards. You talk with a few successful agents at
your office, and they tell you that you should really get a professional
photo taken first. They also suggest updating your wardrobe to look more
professional. So this simple task of ordering business cards has turned
into a much more complicated chore. Instead of focusing on creating the
perfect business card, I recommend ordering a small batch of cards
without a photo. You can reorder cards once you have had a chance to get
that professional photo taken. Perhaps you could delay that wardrobe
upgrade as a reward for your first closing? Don’t let the perfect get in
the way of making progress now.

## Tasks vs Appointments

Your real estate CRM includes a calendar to track your appointments and
important deadlines, such as listing expiration dates. It is tempting to
add tasks to your calendar, like picking up dry cleaning or dropping off
a yard sign. But I do not recommend using your calendar for such
activities. I recommend using your task list instead. What is the
difference between the two? Appointments have a date and time, usually a
location, and someone you are meeting with. You never want to miss an
appointment, so there is no way to mark it done like you can with a
task. Tasks are different; they do not have a time associated with them.
They can be marked done. If you forget to complete a task, it stays
around until you mark it done.

You should color-code your appointments to indicate the types of
activities you will be doing, such as client appointments, office hours,
showings, and more. When you are working in a team, you will want to
share a single calendar and use color-coding to assign appointments to
team members.


> **Task vs Appointment Secret**: Keep your task list separated from your calendar, tasks go in your task list and appointments go in your calendar. Task: A to-do item without a fixed time, for example: install yard sign, follow up with Jane. Appointment: A hard commitment at a specific time and place, for example: a closing or a showing.


You should sync your real estate CRM calendar with your smartphone. That
way, you will always have your calendar at hand. You should also set up
alarms so you receive timely notifications on your smartphone. That way,
you are never late or miss a meeting. Some smartphones will even notify
you based on the meeting location and your GPS location at the time of
the appointment. So, if the appointment is 20 minutes away, your phone
can notify you 25 minutes beforehand, giving you enough time to get
there. One additional advantage of syncing your real estate CRM’s
calendar with your smartphone is that you can use its GPS navigation to
get live turn-by-turn directions as you drive to the appointment.

Your real estate CRM can automatically add contact information, such as
names and phone numbers to the notes field of your appointments. That
way, details about who you are meeting, when, and where are always
available on your smartphone.

## Task Plans

Ideally, you will have just a handful of appointments each day, but you
might have several dozen tasks. You can create a task plan, sometimes
called an activity plan, to assign a series of tasks to a prospect or
deal. These tasks can be spaced out over time. For example, you might
schedule sending a series of postcards over time, with postcard 1 on day
1, postcard 2 on day 7, and so on. You could easily assign that task
plan, and the task timing would be automatically calculated.


> **The Tasks Together Secret**: Add the same category to tasks that done together, so you can batch errands and site visits efficiently, cutting wasted travel time.


One important thing about tasks is that they remain until you complete
them. Appointments are visible only on the date they are assigned. For
this reason, tasks are usually preferred for scheduling follow-up phone
calls. That way, if you are running late and can’t make the follow-up
call today, you will be reminded to make it tomorrow.

You should think of tasks as promises you make to yourself to do
something. A common pitfall is assigning a series of tasks one day, then
procrastinating when it comes time to do them. These unfinished tasks
accumulate, creating an impossible situation for you later. This can
happen with follow-up phone calls, which is why I always recommend
making your first phone call with a lead or client before scheduling any
follow-up tasks.

Most agents use a checklist to prepare a listing, including picking up
the key, taking photos, listing the property in the MLS, and more. A
task plan can be applied to a listing record to ensure a consistent
workflow. Your real estate CRM has these items pre-created and ready for
your use, allowing you to instantly apply a sequence of tasks to any new
listing or closing. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. By
leveraging the pre-built task plans in your CRM, you can ensure no
critical step is missed and deliver a consistent, professional level of
service to every client.


> **One-and-Done Task Secret:** Whenever possible, handle each task only once. Avoid re-reading the same emails, notes, or to-dos multiple times without action.


You can also tweak these automated task plans to match your operating
style. If you hang door knockers on neighbors’ doors before a home comes
up for sale, you can add that to the standardized list of promotions for
all your listings. That way, each of your listings has a consistent set
of tasks to complete.

Most people will have one task plan for their listings, another for the
buy-side closings, and another for their sell-side closings. Each
agent’s responsibilities differ depending on which side they are on. So,
the checklist will be different depending on which side of the deal you
represent. The last thing you want to do is show up at closing and
realize the Homeowners Association (HOA) documents weren’t sent 7 days
earlier, which would delay the closing!

### Wayne Birkey

What’s better than being good? Being consistent - because people trust
consistency. This is the idea Wayne Birkey, an agent with Cressy &
Everett Real Estate in Granger, Indiana, has built his career on. With
more than 40 years of experience as a builder, agent, and broker, Wayne
uses his extensive knowledge of construction and real estate
transactions to find the perfect home for each client. One of Wayne’s
customers, Ashley Fulbright of South Bend, said, “Wayne was amazing to
work with. As a first-time home buyer, the process of finding and
purchasing a home can be very daunting and stressful, but Wayne made it
manageable and even easy for me. He handled everything and did a lot
behind the scenes to keep the purchase process moving that I didn’t even
have to worry about, leading us to close in only three weeks!”

Here are the steps Wayne takes when he follows up with a client. First,
he reviews the date and time-stamped notes in his CRM. He also looks at
the tasks he has completed. His notes include lists of items his client
needs to be informed about, as well as what he needs from his client to
ensure the transaction goes smoothly from one stage to the next. His
public client reviews are unanimous in their praise of his proactive
approach to making sure that deals close with a minimum of delay. All
details are known, all contingencies accounted for, which lowers stress
for the client and reduces the risk of a deal being delayed or failing.
He meticulously tracks every client detail from legal documents to
birthdays. “I use a lot of different real estate tools, but they all
feed back into my CRM.” He says.

Many agents are great at talking with and converting new leads, but
struggle to maintain the relationships they have already made. Wayne
spends a small portion of each day working through his task list,
calling current leads and existing clients. He is also careful to update
his notes in his CRM so that everything is in one place. That way, he
can easily find any information he might need quickly and keep all his
notes at hand while he is talking on the phone. Wayne uses the touch
tasks and task plan features in his CRM to schedule follow-up, along
with detailed task checklists to ensure nothing is missed.

Wayne has gained a reputation as an honest broker who listens to his
clients’ needs and helps them find the perfect home in the right
neighborhood. He must be doing something right, as his online reviews
are stellar, and many of his clients are repeat business and referrals.
One customer, Melissa Guthrie, said: “I first met Wayne a couple of
years ago when he helped my son purchase his first home. He went above
and beyond to help him at every step of the process. I didn’t hesitate
to call Wayne when I found a home I wanted to see. He was helpful every
step of the way!” she went on, “Wayne was always prepared for every
step. He communicated everything I needed to know right away. The entire
purchasing of my new home could not have gone any better. Wayne was
always right on time with everything I needed. Great communication in
every way.” His ability to provide trustworthy, reliable service to his
clients keeps him top of mind and attracts referral business from
friends and family.

—«◊»—

You can also schedule tasks to be due relative to specific dates, such
as a contract’s closing or ratification date. That way, you can schedule
a series of activities that sequence based on these special dates, such
as putting up the yard sign 1 day after the listing agreement is signed
or providing closing documents 7 days before closing. If the closing is
delayed, these tasks will automatically have their due dates adjusted.

## Touch Cycle

The single most helpful feature of a real estate CRM is the ability to
schedule follow-ups. These tasks are so important that your CRM lets you
easily schedule one-time or recurring follow-ups. This is called the
**touch cycle**, and it is the best way to maintain regular contact with
the people in your database.


A typical situation is to schedule a touch cycle task to contact someone
every 2 weeks. When you mark that task complete, it automatically
updates the last contact date to today and sets the next due date to two
weeks from today. Because tasks can be completed on the due date, a
little early, or even a little late, using a repeating task ensures that
the next due date is always two weeks from the last contact date, which
is when you made your previous call. If you had instead used a series of
non-repeating tasks, you would not have the same level of automatic
adjustment.

While many people think of touch as making a phone call, I recommend you
broaden your thinking to include any form of contact. You might call,
send an email, send a postcard, a Christmas or birthday card, drop by,
or even send a text message. By giving yourself the flexibility to
decide how you will contact that person, you make it easier to reach
them. Most people can only answer the phone at certain times of day. For
example, it would not be appropriate to call someone at 6 am, but you
could easily schedule an email or mail a postcard if you were working at
6 a.m. and wanted to touch base.


> **The Click, Call, Close Secret**: Each day you should schedule time in your calendar to making follow-up calls. To speed up this process build a daily call list and use the click-to-dial feature in your CRM to quickly call one person after the other. Add notes as you talk and schedule a follow-up call before you hang up.


Your CRM can generate a **daily call list** of people you need to
contact today. This list includes all tasks due today, including
repeating touch-cycle and follow-up tasks. It also includes any
uncompleted tasks that are overdue. You can then make one call after
another by clicking each task in turn. You can easily pull up each
contact record, review your notes, make your call, add notes, and then
call the next person with minimal effort.

## Systems to Simplify Work

When you first start, you will handle every activity yourself, including
putting up yard signs, taking photographs, and creating flyers. As your
business grows, you may find there are not enough hours in the day to
get everything done. I recommend using your real estate CRM to stay
organized and systematize your activities.

As you gain experience, you can create checklists for new listings and
closings that you would assign when a listing or closing is created.
That way, you provide a uniform level of service to each client. This
system also simplifies bringing on an assistant or partner, as you can
assign tasks and track progress without spending all your time
supervising them. As your business grows, you can systematize marketing
activities, such as sending postcards, by using your CRM to build,
organize, and track your mailing lists.

You should not feel forced to work with everyone, such as a seller with
unrealistic price expectations or someone unwilling to put their home in
show-ready condition. Likewise, consider the sales price of the homes
you target. Helping a buyer find a double-wide trailer will yield less
commission than helping a client purchase a high-end colonial-style
home, but both may require the same amount of time and cost the same in
gas money. Before taking on a client, use your CRM to model different
commission scenarios and decide whether taking on a new client makes
financial sense for you.

Your real estate CRM also enables you to pursue different work
arrangements that might otherwise be difficult. You may be a part-time
agent and would like to partner with another agent to maintain a
work-life balance. The multi-user capability of your CRM allows you to
co-work with another part-time agent so that each of you can tag-team
your work. You could also work as a junior partner for a full-time
agent.

Ultimately, a systemized business is one you can step away from. Real
estate agents often struggle to take time off due to illness. With a
CRM, you can grant another agent read-only access to manage your affairs
while you are unavailable. This is one reason many agents team up:
working together can reduce stress.

## Real Estate Calculators

Your real estate CRM includes several calculators to help qualify
prospects. Ideally, your buyer would first meet with a mortgage
professional and get pre-approved before meeting with you. However, some
buyers will not do that and will instead meet with you first. Using the
**maximum loan calculator**, you can quickly determine the price range
your prospect should qualify for based on income, debt, and loan terms.
That estimate helps you align expectations and set a ballpark maximum
home price. That way, you can start showing homes immediately without
waiting for your prospect to consult with a mortgage professional.

While there are many reasons for the high rate of deal failure, a
significant one is that the buyer could not afford the home they thought
they could[13]. Rather than spending hundreds of hours on a deal that
falls apart at the last minute, you can educate your client beforehand
and save yourself wasted effort.


> **Budget Before Browse Secret:** For buyers who have not yet met a loan officer, use your CRM’s ‘maximum loan calculator’ in your very first meeting with a new buyer to set a realistic price range before showing homes. This prevents wasted time on unaffordable properties and establishes you as a knowledgeable, financially savvy advisor from the start.


The **seller’s net calculator** helps you quickly determine how much
cash back a seller can expect from the sale of their home after
deducting commission and other expenses. The last thing you want is for
the seller to be surprised at closing and realize that, after fees and
commissions, they will be taking home far less than they thought. Many
people use the proceeds from the sale of their current home as a down
payment for a new home. The seller’s net calculator helps you determine
how much of a down payment your client might have available for the
purchase of their next home.

For your buyers, the **buyer’s net calculator** is a helpful way to
explain down payment and closing cost requirements, including the
buy-side commission. Most buyers understand the down payment
requirements but are often unaware of the precise amount of funds they
might need, and this calculator can help set expectations.

The **commission calculator** computes your gross commission and final
net commission after deductions for split, franchise, and referral fees.
Use this calculator before taking on a client to clarify the financial
stakes and ensure your marketing budget aligns with the potential
return. While your broker will provide a final calculation, compute it
yourself to project cash flow and double-check your broker’s figures for
accuracy. This also helps you precisely calculate and document any
referral fees you give or receive.

Another handy calculator is **rent-vs-own**. We all know there are
numerous benefits to owning a home compared with renting. Some of these
benefits are psychological, but there are financial benefits as well. A
rent-vs-own calculator computes these specific benefits, including home
appreciation, as well as the tax benefits of owning a home. There are
also circumstances when renting makes the most sense, for example, if
the buyer is uncertain how long they will remain in the house. The
rent-vs-own calculator takes the guesswork out of these calculations and
allows the buyer to explore different holding periods, appreciation
scenarios, and even alternative uses for the down payment, such as
investing in the stock market.

Less sophisticated clients may focus solely on monthly payments. By
explicitly highlighting appreciation, you can explain the benefits of
choosing a home in an area with appreciation potential, as well as the
value of paying a little more for a home with features others might find
desirable when it is time to sell.

The rent-vs-own calculator also offers property investors insights into
the optimal time to sell assets from their real estate portfolio. For
example, when the calculator shows a financial benefit to renting over
owning, this can signal a market imbalance. This imbalance could be
caused by artificially high interest rates or unusually low rents.
Whatever the reason for the imbalance, it can make holding a rental
property less profitable for a landlord. This might mean it’s a good
time to sell the investment property.

The **mortgage payments calculator** is helpful when a buyer needs to
compare different loan programs or interest rates. For example, what
would the payment difference be with a 20 percent down payment to avoid
PMI? What would the payment difference be between a 15-year and a
30-year loan? What about two loans compared with a single jumbo loan?
The loan payments calculator allows a buyer to strategize and become
comfortable with a specific home price and different loan types,
including paying points. It also allows a candid conversation about the
home price range the buyer can comfortably afford and qualify for.

The real estate calculators built into your real estate CRM are
excellent sales tools. They help you approach your prospect and gather
information they might otherwise be uncomfortable sharing, such as
salary and debt. Entering this information into a calculator takes the
stress out of the process, as it is a scientific, non-judgmental way to
explore different options. Finally, these calculators allow you to
provide hard-copy results to your client so they can better study the
underlying analysis.

## Budgeting Tips

Like farming crops, real estate is typically seasonal, with summer
months being a “feast” and winter months a “famine.” Through careful
planning, you can stockpile funds during the busy months to last through
the slower months. The first step toward financial stability is gaining
clarity on your revenue. Your CRM lets you project future income by
tracking your pipeline of listings and active buyers, using their price
ranges and estimated close dates. You can make income projections using
the built-in commission calculator to determine your expected net
commission after accounting for deductions such as splits, franchise
fees, and referral fees. Understanding your true net pay is crucial for
making smart decisions about your marketing budget and expected income
in future months.

Beyond commissions, your CRM can also track other income sources. These
include **Broker Price Opinions** (BPOs), which estimate a property’s
probable selling price. Lenders often request BPOs in situations like
foreclosures, where a full appraisal is not required. Providing PBO’s is
one additional source of income for real estate agents. Other income
streams include finder’s fees for rental properties, referral fees from
other agents, and income from services such as yard sign installation,
open house hosting, and photography for other agents.


> **Know your Net Secret:** Use your CRM to calculate net commission after splits, franchise fees, and referral fees. You can use these figures alongside your expenses to work out cash flow and take-home pay.


Equally important is managing your expenses, which are of two kinds.
Fixed expenses include licensing fees, membership dues, and insurance,
which you will have regardless of how much (or little) you sell. Your
CRM can track when these payments are due, so you can ensure your bank
account balance is sufficient to cover them. For some annual payments,
such as licensing fees, insurance, and membership fees, you may be able
to adjust the due dates or prepay these costs at times of year when your
bank balance is at its highest. 

You must also consider the time between when you incur these expenses
and when you are paid. These delays are typically several months. It is
also possible that you will incur expenses but never earn a commission
if a deal is never completed. By tracking your expenses for each
listing, you can build an understanding of the expenses for each new
listing and compare them against your projected commission for that
listing.

Variable expenses include costs such as gas, professional photography,
advertising, and other promotional activities.

The IRS considers real estate agents self-employed, so you are required
to pay quarterly estimated taxes. Self-employed individuals also face
the highest audit rate, so you will need to document your deductions
carefully. The IRS is particularly focused on distinguishing between
personal and business expenses, especially restaurant and automobile
costs, where the lines can be blurry. Your real estate CRM allows you to
upload receipts, which can be a convenient way to document these
expenses.

### Mike Holbrook

For real estate agents, annual tax preparation is a big stressor with
serious consequences if done incorrectly. Top Florida agent Mike
Holbrook avoids this stress by meticulously tracking expenses in his
real estate CRM. Mike records his individual and recurring costs, then
attaches a digital scan of the receipt because Mike says, “Everyone
should be making digital copies - receipts fade.” Mike also records his
income by documenting transactions in his CRM's closing features. This
means all of his costs and income are recorded and verified in a single
place. Mike says, “My CRM makes it so freaking easy – I can print out my
deductions in a matter of seconds. When I talk to other agents at the
beginning of the year, I hear: Tax time is coming – it is going to take
me forever with all the receipts and I'm like: Dude, it's going to take
me two seconds.” This is a lesser-known advantage of CRMs that many
agents do not appreciate.

**Automobile expenses** will likely be your most significant variable
expense. You must meticulously document your business mileage, as the
IRS scrutinizes these expenses. A GPS-tracking smartphone app is the
easiest way to maintain the necessary log. For your taxes, you can
deduct these costs using one of two methods. The simplest is the mileage
method, where you multiply your business miles by a set reimbursement
rate. With this approach, you do not track gas or maintenance costs, as
they are included in the reimbursement rate. The other method is the
actual expense method, where you track every cost, including gas, car
payments, and maintenance, and deduct the portion corresponding to your
business use percentage. For simplicity, I recommend the mileage method.
There are rules about switching methods once you have chosen one. For
this reason, I suggest you decide which method you will use and stick to
it for the life of your vehicle. Consult with a tax professional for
more detailed advice tailored to your individual situation.

To maximize your car deduction, you should establish a **home office**.
A real estate agent’s home office is a dedicated workspace within their
residence for professional real estate activities, including client
communication, marketing, transaction coordination, and administrative
tasks. It typically includes essential office equipment and a secure
internet connection.

If you have a home office, you can treat miles driven from your home to
any business appointment as deductible business mileage rather than
non-deductible commuting. A home office also allows you to deduct a
portion of your utilities, internet, and phone bills. Be aware that
there are tax implications when you sell your home. Capital gains are
the profits you make when you sell an asset for more than you originally
paid for it. While the tax code allows most homeowners to exclude a
large amount of this profit from taxes on their primary residence, this
exclusion does not apply to any part of the home used for business
purposes, such as your home office. This means the profit attributable
to that portion of your home becomes taxable. Regardless of the method
you choose for car expenses, you can still deduct tolls, parking costs,
interest on a car loan, and insurance.

There are two ways to calculate your home office deduction. The simplest
method is the “simplified method,” which multiplies your home office’s
square footage by a fixed reimbursement rate. The advantage of the
simplified method is that it reduces your record-keeping and makes it
much easier to track. The other method, called the “regular method,” is
considerably more complicated.

### Susan Mogren

When Susan Mogren returned to real estate in Massachusetts after a
20-year hiatus, she found an industry transformed by technology. Susan
realized she needed to start using a contact management system to
rebuild her sphere of influence. Mogren’s goal was to build her business
through referrals. She wanted to provide each client with exemplary real
estate services that would have them enthusiastically recommend her to
family and friends. She found several specialized real estate CRM
solutions, but Susan wasn’t looking for just any system. “It had to be
user-friendly, simple to learn and operate, and economical,” she
explains.

At first, she struggled with the learning curve. “My children were my
tech support, and when they moved out, I was on my own. So, I decided it
was time to really learn this thing.” Susan stated. As she began to
understand her new tools better, she started to blend her personal
touches with modern tech.

“I dove in and immediately set up my expenses so I could track what I
was doing and see how much it cost me to be a Realtor,” she recalls.”
She further explained, “For the past 3 years, I have sorted all my
expenses by category and run a report to give to my accountant at year’s
end. Most Realtors like to reduce costs to increase profits, and this
helps me keep an eye on it,” she says.”

Susan continued, “Next, I added everyone I knew to the contacts
category, and use it as my address book, and keep notes and ‘touches’ in
it. It easily allows me to export a full mailing list, or a defined
category called ‘seniors’ or ‘neighbors’ to send out a smaller mailing.”
Her contact database now includes hundreds of names.

Susan makes many door-to-door visits and is constantly on the go. So,
she decided she needed more mobile technology. “I didn’t think I’d be
using an iPad for real estate at the start. But now I can’t imagine how
much less face-to-face time I’d get if I didn’t!” she stated. She uses
her CRM on her iPad to see who else she can call on in the area. By
segmenting her mailing lists, she can target people in the same
geographic area for calls. If they aren’t home, she leaves a small gift
on each client’s doorstep and then texts them a photo of the package to
start a conversation.

Some agents delegate their tax preparation to an accountant. I recommend
a more hands-on approach. You can use your CRM to calculate your own
subtotals before meeting with a tax professional. By reviewing your
receipts, you are more likely to spot missing deductions, which you can
add later. Providing your accountant with organized subtotals leads to a
more accurate tax return and a lower preparation fee. This data also
helps you budget for next year, analyze your return on investment across
your lead sources, and strategically allocate your time and money for
the greatest impact. Real estate coaches have identified cash flow and
running out of money as the single biggest reason real estate agents
quit the field. While features like lead incubation, drip emails, and
flyers are helpful, tracking your income and expenses provides key
insights that help you survive your first full season.


> **The Tax Tag Tally Secret**: When entering business expenses into your CRM make sure to assign each expense one specific tax category. By using the categories that match the categories the IRS uses, you save yourself time when you do your taxes. You can then easily **export sub-totals** for each category, which can be used to fill out your taxes.


Some services operate like payday loans, offering agents cash advances
against future commissions. While these services provide quick access to
funds, I do not recommend using them. The Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
can be as high as 60% for these loans. But the high cost is not the only
risk. If a deal falls through, you would be immediately responsible for
repaying the advance. With a real estate closing failure rate of twenty
percent or higher, this is a significant financial gamble. Some
providers may also lack full transparency about their fee structures,
leading to unexpected charges for wire transfers, administration, or
applications.

I recommend that you instead maintain a cash cushion in your bank
account sufficient to cover several months without income. Being a real
estate agent means your income is irregular and less predictable than in
other lines of work. You will often be paid a large sum of money all at
once. While it is tempting to splurge during prosperous times, you must
remember that lean months will follow. Keeping an adequate cash balance
in your bank account is essential. If you do need a loan, a home equity
loan or a personal loan from a bank is a much better financial option
than a commission advance service.

Another cash flow strategy is to use lead-generation services that
charge only after a deal closes. This model has a few advantages. If you
do not close, you do not pay, and you do not have to pay for leads up
front. This can be a useful option for agents without a large
advertising budget. However, there are also several disadvantages to
using these services. The quality of the leads is typically lower, so
you will spend more time on unproductive leads. You will also have less
control over your leads, making it harder to manage the quality and
quantity of your prospects. The fees are substantial and can range from
25% to 40% of your commission.

For these reasons, pay-on-closing leads are not well-suited for new
agents. New agents have less experience closing deals, and the low
quality of these leads means you will spend a great deal of time on
hard-to-convert prospects. As a result, you could spend months pursuing
these leads before securing a single sale. I recommend first focusing on
leads who already know you. Your first clients should come from your
sphere of influence, such as friends, family, and community connections
from church or school, where you have an established reputation. Your
ability to convert complete strangers will be limited when you are just
starting. You should first perfect your craft with people who already
know and trust you. Once your skills are more polished, you can then
refocus on more challenging prospects with lower conversion rates.

## Storing Files

Agents have a lot of paperwork to keep track of, including listing,
sales, and disclosure contracts. In the past, this information was
stored in paper form in your office. Today, most of this documentation
is in electronic form, such as PDFs. So, instead of a filing cabinet to
store your documents, you need an electronic filing cabinet.

One of the best electronic filing cabinets you can use is Google Drive.
It is an online service provided by Google for free with any Gmail
account. The free version offers significant storage, and if you need
more, you can purchase additional storage for a nominal fee. I recommend
Google Drive because the cost is reasonable and it is available on your
computer and mobile phone. It also integrates seamlessly with your Gmail
account, so you can easily add file attachments to Google Drive without
downloading and re-uploading. Google Drive's security is excellent,
including two-factor authentication.


> **Trip Trimmer Secret:** By storing your files in the cloud, you reduce your need to drive somewhere to access important documents. This saves you on trips to pick up and drop off paperwork.


You can also share individual documents or entire folders with others,
such as other agents, your client, the closing company, loan officers,
and attorneys. Your Real estate CRM can integrate with your Google Drive
folder, so you can quickly access the documentation for each of your
listings. Other online file storage platforms offer similar
functionality. Dropbox and OneDrive are two examples of competing
systems.
