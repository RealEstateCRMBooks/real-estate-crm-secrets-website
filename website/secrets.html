                            you get is probably also reaching out to other agents as well. Take advantage of the

                            click-to-dial, and smart phone synchronization.</p>

                        <p>Always be able to answer the question: “How is the market?” When you answer, it should be
                            with an in-depth explanation that includes local inventory levels, average days on the
                            market, and recent sales. Taking a step beyond “yes,” “no,” or “it’s complicated” is
                            important in selling yourself by showing that you are an authority on the market.</p>

                            Check your calendar for your hard commitments, as well as your tasks list which are
                            activities which you can handle between appointments. This is your way of holding yourself
                            accountable for making the most of every day. Without a plan, it is too easy to get

                            can maintain a steady flow of new prospects. Think of this as your &ldquo;me&rdquo; time. At

                        <p>For buyers who have not yet met a loan officer, use your CRM’s maximum loan calculator in
                            your very first meeting with a new buyer to set a realistic price range before showing
                            homes. This prevents wasted time on unaffordable properties and establishes you as a
                            knowledgeable, financially savvy advisor from the start.</p>

                            This simple act changes your marketing material into a community service piece. Instead of
                            just another agent with just another listing, you become a friend of dogs everywhere.</p>
