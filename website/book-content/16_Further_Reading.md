# Further Reading

This book, *Real Estate CRM Secrets*, focuses on the core systems a new
agent needs to get organized, build consistent habits, and grow their
business. I have also written a companion book, *Real Estate CRM
Mastery*, designed for the experienced agent who has mastered these
essentials and is ready to scale their production. It covers advanced
strategies for managing time, automating marketing, and leading a team
or an assistant. Together, these two books offer a complete, repeatable
system for transforming a new agent into a top-producing real estate
professional.

If you are looking to explore the business concepts discussed in this
book further, I recommend the following books.

*Your First Year in Real Estate* by Dirk Zeller is a comprehensive
roadmap for novice real estate agents seeking to build a successful
career.

*Your First 365 Days in Real Estate* by Shelley Zavitz is an honest,
practical, and highly relatable guide for new real estate agents,
especially those starting without an established network.

*Sold: Every Real Estate Agent’s Guide to Building a Profitable
Business* by David Greene details strategies for lead generation and
client management, emphasizing a proactive, entrepreneurial mindset.

*Ninja Selling* by Larry Kendall teaches a system for creating
predictable sales by building relationships and providing value, both of
which are key to nurturing leads through the sales funnel.

*The Millionaire Real Estate Agent* by Gary Keller et al. offers a
proven, systematic formula for real estate professionals to build a
thriving, million-dollar business. The core philosophy centers on
adopting a “Millionaire Mindset” and mastering the “Three L’s”: Leads,
Listings, and Leverage.

*Selling with Soul* by Jennifer Allan is a “rookie survival guide” that
vehemently rejects the high-pressure, “Old School” sales tactics often
taught in the industry. The book’s core message is that an extraordinary
real estate career is built on the pillars of Respect, Competence,
Enthusiasm, and Confidence, achieved by prioritizing the client’s needs
and practicing the Golden Rule.

*Fanatical Prospecting* by Jeb Blount is a rigorous, no-excuses guide
that argues the number one reason for sales failure is an empty
pipeline, caused by a lack of consistent prospecting.

*The Book of Yes* by Kevin Ward provides real-world scripts to help
agents handle objections and close more deals.

*Endless Referrals* by Bob Burg explains how to build a network and
generate business through relationship-based marketing.
