# Real Estate CRM Features

This chapter will help you identify key features in your real estate CRM
that can help you work more effectively. I will also describe other
features you might find helpful in the future. Finally, I will identify
features that are not useful or even dangerous to use. We would all like
to press a button and have a robot do our job for us. But there are
pitfalls to automating the personal aspect of your job, particularly in
early sales incubation, where you are competing with other agents for
the job.

## Choose Your CRM

There are many real estate CRMs to choose from, and finding the perfect
one can feel overwhelming. I recommend prioritizing your selection based
on two factors: ease of use and technical support. Why?

Most real estate agents use only a fraction of the features available in
their CRM[8]. The reason is that you can’t use features you don’t know
about or don’t know how to operate. The most significant factors in your
successful use of a real estate CRM are the quality of training your CRM
vendor provides and how straightforward your CRM is to use. While each
real estate CRM vendor will have a slightly different set of features,
most will share a common core set. For this reason, I recommend focusing
on technical support and training. After all, you can only use the
features you know how to use!


> **Trust But Verify Secret**: CRM vendors sometimes advertise features that sound amazing. But sometimes things sound better than they are. The only way to trust a CRM feature is to use the free trial and personally test that feature. If you get stuck, call technical support. That’s when you’ll find out if those features were too good to be true and how good the technical support really is. The last thing you want to do is purchase a CRM and then later realize that the product is buggy, works imperfectly, or the salesperson exaggerated its capabilities.


Real estate CRM pricing can vary widely. While you might think a more
expensive CRM is better, that isn’t necessarily true. In fact, the more
costly real estate CRMs tend to be more narrowly focused, whereas the
more affordable ones tend to appeal to a broader audience. I recommend
starting with a more affordable real estate CRM. When you first start,
you probably aren’t sure exactly what it can do for you, so it’s hard to
justify selecting a CRM that costs 10x more than another one right away.

You can switch to a more expensive CRM later if your needs change and
you can justify the cost. However, a higher price does not guarantee
more features or better technical support. Keep an eye out for add-on
costs or technical support charges. Also, review the refund policies.
You should find a vendor who will give you a no-questions, pro-rated
refund at any time. Some of the less reputable vendors require a
one-year lock-in. I recommend sticking with vendors that allow
cancellation at any time.

The real estate CRM business is highly competitive. Vendors constantly
add features and make improvements. It’s easy to get distracted by
trendy new features. Given the competition, you can expect new features
to be continually added to any CRM you select. While new features might
be valuable, it’s not unusual for features that were touted one year to
turn out to be duds or dead ends the next. Chasing new features, while
exciting, can have disadvantages. A few years ago, automated SMS texting
was trendy. After several lawsuits, it became clear that certain
restrictions on SMS texting were necessary to comply with federal
regulations. For this reason, I recommend focusing on key features
instead. Most agents are busy and really can’t afford to waste time on
trendy or unproven features that don’t quite work right or create legal
liability.

Don’t buy based on features you might need or features you have not
personally used. Sometimes features seem better on paper, but when you
try them, you find they make no sense.

Some automation can be useful, such as scheduling time-release emails.
Those features help you stay consistent with your follow-up. However, if
your initial strategy is poor, a CRM will amplify it and deliver poor
results. More automation is not necessarily a good thing. Keep in mind,
people are savvy to automated robotic emails. The best features of your
CRM will be those that operate under your supervision. This ensures that
everything is working correctly and enables you to provide
individualized attention to your clients. Carefully test anything that
your CRM is doing behind your back. Proofread the content that is sent
with your name on it. Make sure that any time-release letters are
carefully structured so that you don’t accidentally send them
automatically at the wrong time.

You should take advantage of the complimentary training offered by your
real estate CRM vendor. Start by learning basic features, such as
syncing with your smartphone, sending bulk email, and using text message
chat. Then build on that with more advanced features, such as deal
tracking. It is better to know a few features well than many features
poorly. This is because the real benefit of your CRM is in regular use.
Just like reading your email, you should use your real estate CRM every
day. Ultimately, the best CRM is the one you will use consistently. By
prioritizing ease of use, quality training, and responsive technical
support, you can get the most from any tool you select.

## Core CRM Features

While each CRM looks and works differently, they all share core
organizational features. These include creating **contact records** with
detailed notes and setting up **appointments** and tasks to track your
follow-up. Tasks can be organized into checklists, called **task
plans**, which help you create a standard operating procedure for your
prospects, listings, and buyers. All modern real estate CRMs are
cloud-based, allowing you to access your information from anywhere on
any device.

Task plans are ideal for managing checklists of tasks to be completed.
For follow-up, a single repeating task is a straightforward way to
maintain regular contact. This type of repeating task is so important
that it has a special name, the **touch cycle**. Your CRM can create a
list of everyone you need to contact today, often called a **daily call
list**. While the most common form of contact is a phone call, any
contact—such as a text message, an email, a printed letter, a postcard,
or even a drive-by visit—counts as a touch.

Beyond these core functions, there is significant variability in the
available features. This often depends on how long the vendor has been
in business and their specific focus. A few CRMs offer a comprehensive
set of features. However, less established real estate CRMs tend to
offer fewer options. You should not choose a real estate CRM solely
because it has more features. Instead, I recommend identifying which
features are most important to you and prioritizing those features. Each
agent will use different features based on their prospecting methods and
personal workflow. No agent will use all, or even most, of the available
features. You won’t miss features you don’t plan to use!


> **The Text to Top Secret**: Consider adding new notes to the top of the notes field, rather than the end. That way, you don’t have to scroll to the end of the notes to see the latest note. Your CRM may have a preference setting which makes this automatic.


Your CRMs will support **mail merge**, which personalizes content such
as letters, emails, or labels. This is done by replacing mail merge
variables in a template with information from your contact or deal
record. This allows you to generate personalized documents from
templates in your content library. Instead of “Dear Sir,” you can write
“Dear Jack & Sandy.”

Your existing email program is great for sending hand-crafted individual
emails immediately. However, it is not suitable for sending a sequence
of time-release emails spaced out over time. This feature, called **drip
email**, is useful for nurturing new leads. Your CRM can help you assign
a drip sequence to someone and automatically send those emails in the
order and frequency you specify, such as once a week.

A similar feature is the ability to send a **bulk email**—the same
message to several people at once—with each email personalized using
mail merge variables. When bulk emails are sent, they are not BCC or CC
emails; instead, they are individual mail-merged emails sent to one
person at a time, which is not the same as what you can do with your
existing email program.

Both bulk and drip emails from your CRM include all the features
required to comply with federal regulations, such as an opt-out link and
a physical return mailing address.

Another tremendously powerful feature is the use of **SMS text message
chat** in your CRM. This is just like the SMS texting feature on your
smartphone, but since it is part of your CRM, the message thread is
linked to your deal and contact records for easy review.

Again, there are legal requirements for honoring STOP requests and
providing the legally required disclaimers. Your CRM makes sure you
fully comply with these legal requirements.

**Click-to-dial** functionality is very popular because it lets you
click a link on your computer to call someone from your mobile phone. It
is a real time-saver for agents who spend significant time making phone
calls.

The ability to **print letters**, **labels**, and **envelopes** is also
essential. This is particularly true for agents looking to prospect
FSBOs, expired listings, or probate leads, as you are unlikely to have
an email address for those kinds of leads, and, in the case of probate
leads, email might be considered tacky. You might find that some newer
CRMs do not offer print functionality. I recommend avoiding selecting a
CRM that lacks printing support. Your ability to print mailing labels is
particularly valuable for mailing your annual Christmas cards. This is
critical for ensuring your mailing addresses are accurate in your
database and for maintaining contact with your sphere of influence.

Your ability to use multiple forms of communication is essential. In
some cases, a friend or prospect may not respond to a single method
because their phone number or email address is no longer in use. By
maintaining multiple independent communication channels, you can stay in
touch even when one method becomes invalid. Also, some people prefer
specific forms of communication over others. For example, younger people
may not answer their phone when you call, and are more likely to reply
to a text message. Similarly, many people hate unsolicited email because
they consider it spam and will never respond to it.

A common need is the ability to import data from a variety of sources,
such as other CRMs, FSBOs, expired listings, probate leads, leads from
other agents, or from your broker.

Agents spend a great deal of time out of the office and need a CRM they
can use in the field. The most basic mobile functionality is
**synchronization** with the native contacts and calendar applications
on your smartphone, whether it is an Android or an iPhone.
Synchronization fidelity varies by vendor. Some vendors provide only a
basic “push” of data to the agent’s smartphone, so changes made on the
agent's phone are not reflected in the CRM. Most others offer full,
two-way synchronization, where changes made in one location are updated
in the other. However, there are nuances to what is synchronized and how
it is done. Contact records can include notes, categories, mailing
addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdays, anniversaries, and
closing anniversaries. They can also track the names of family members
and pets, along with their birthdays. Additionally, advanced
functionality can include custom fields, which are handy for specialized
prospecting. Each CRM is different, so I recommend inquiring about what
is synchronized, what is not, and any limitations.

A **mobile CRM** becomes much more accessible when it can also be used
from the web browser on your phone. You should check whether the CRM is
optimized for low-resolution devices, including iPads. It is also
essential to test if it is fast enough to use when in the field with
cellular data. There used to be CRMs that offered downloadable apps from
the Google or Apple App stores. This is no longer common due to App
Store policies and technical challenges. Nearly all vendors have
standardized on a web interface, though a few do not. Your CRM might
also include an open house form, which you can use on an iPad to collect
contact information during open houses.

New agents are likely to work alone, so **multi-user capability**
probably isn't a top priority at first. However, as you gain experience,
you might want to share your database with a partner or assistant. If
you're interested in exploring the benefits of using your real estate
CRM with others, I recommend reading the second companion volume, *Real
Estate CRM Mastery*. This second book explains how to bring on new team
members and manage that process using the systems built into your real
estate CRM. These systems include delegating tasks, restricting access
to certain features for specific team members, and establishing
accountability and safety measures in case a team member makes a
mistake. The end result of multi-user functionality is that you can
scale your business while maintaining control.

Features like the ability to **undelete** a record, **revert to a
previous version**, and **review change logs** are useful for a single
agent. Everyone makes mistakes, after all. However, these features are
absolutely essential as your team grows and you bring on an
inexperienced assistant who might accidentally delete a record without
realizing it. By maintaining a change log and being able to undelete a
record, you can monitor the situation and recover from any accidents.

## Using Real Estate Specific CRMs

While all CRMs include core features such as contacts, tasks, and a
calendar, a real estate-specific CRM offers additional features tailored
to the unique needs of a real estate agent. For this reason, I do not
recommend using a generic CRM if you are a real estate agent. Instead, I
advise choosing a CRM built for real estate. Below is a summary of key
specialized features that set a real estate CRM apart from a generic
one. You may not use all of these features immediately, but they can
make your life as a real estate agent considerably more efficient.

Most real estate transactions are personal, between two individuals,
often two families. Special attention needs to be paid to each family
member’s needs. Emails and letters are usually addressed to the family
unit and might start with “Dear Jack & Sally.” Real estate agents need
to track birthdays, home closing anniversary dates, and other personal
details for each family member.

Generic CRM’s will instead focus on companies and individuals, and have
no provision for families. A real estate specific CRM is going to allow
you to **track birthdays**, as well as **closing anniversaries,** which
is the date your client purchased their home. This is a valuable
touchpoint for maintaining long-term relationships with your past
clients.


> **The Divorce Divide Secret**: Use one contact record per family to keep communications unified but split them into two records during a divorce to manage the relationship professionally.


A generic CRM typically includes a postal mailing address in each
contact record. A real estate CRM will track both a mailing address and
a property address. This is a key feature when marketing to absentee
owners, or when working with a buyer who is inquiring about a specific
property.

A real estate CRM includes a **library of real estate-specific content**
you can use and customize. This consists of a library of time-release
drip letters for both print and email. These letters can be customized
and used with mail merge to create professional-looking letters. While
time-release drip letters are common, individual one-off letters are
also helpful. Additionally, the ability to send eCards for closing
anniversaries and holidays is quite valuable. eCards provide an easy way
to send a few emails to people in your sphere of influence each year.
This lets you stay in touch and is a great way to detect when an email
address goes bad. A flyer template library allows you to quickly create
a property flyer by filling in the blanks with text and photos. By using
these templates, you can create a consistently professional flyer in
just a few minutes.

Another key feature is called **email feed**, also known as email
parsing. This feature parses the contact information embedded in
new-lead notification emails from hundreds of real estate-specific
websites, such as Trulia and Zillow, and converts them into prospect
records. This saves hours of manual data entry and allows for immediate
outreach. As soon as the record is created, you receive both an email
and an SMS text notification so you can respond within minutes. A
generic CRM cannot parse real estate-specific lead sources, such as
Zillow. This is a crucial feature and a major shortcoming of a generic
CRM. Using a generic CRM will slow you down when speed matters most,
making it unsuitable for real estate-specific use.

Real estate lead sources that deliver leads via email feed typically
offer the ability to send a copy of their notification email to a
dedicated email feed address assigned by your real estate CRM vendor to
your CRM account. Emails sent to that email address are automatically
parsed and converted into prospect records. The advantage of this
approach is that it is fast and automatic. You are also immediately
notified of the new lead via both email and text message. This allows
you to centralize all of your leads within your CRM. So, leads from
Realtor.com, Zillow, Trulia, your own website, advertising like Google
and Facebook ads, and much more can be fed into your CRM using this
automated mechanism.


> **The Speed-to-Lead Secret:** Respond to all online inquiries as quickly as possible, ideally within 5 minutes. Open the lead in your CRM, then make your call. Use your CRM’s features, such as email feed, call capture, click-to-dial, and smartphone synchronization, to be the first agent your prospect talks with over the phone. Statistically, most buyers hire the first agent they speak with, so be that agent1. There is no prize for second place.


Consumer behavior data from the National Association of
Realtors support this statement. According to the 2024 Profile of Home
Buyers and Sellers, 75% of all buyers interviewed only one real estate
agent. This was true for 67% of first-time buyers and 77% of repeat
buyers. This data underscores the “winner-take-all” nature of lead
response: the first agent to make a professional connection and
establish rapport is most likely to be hired for the job.↩︎


FSBO and expired leads also lend themselves well to the automation that
a real estate CRM offers. For example, if you regularly load FSBO leads
from a service, your CRM can keep track of which letters and postcards
have been sent and print letters and labels for the next batch to go
out. Each prospect would be in a different place in the sequence, and
your CRM manages who gets what for you.

While internet leads are typically fed live via email, leads generated
through data mining, such as FSBOs, expireds, and probate leads, are
typically loaded using the import feature, which allows you to map data
from lead sources to the fields in your CRM. The best real estate CRMs
offer a **valet import** feature. This is a service in which the CRM
vendor creates a custom importer tailored to the specific lead service
you use. A dedicated menu item is created for your import. All you need
to do is select that menu item and click import. This significantly
automates the import, making the process nearly foolproof. Generic CRMs
might allow custom field mapping, but require you to assign it yourself
each time you import. This can turn a process that might take 10 seconds
into one that could easily take 10 minutes and be more error-prone.
Using the valet import makes the process seamless and straightforward.

It is helpful to distinguish between these two ways to add leads to your
CRM. You will find use for both methods. The first method, email feed,
is designed for live, individual web leads. This feature automatically
reads the notification email for a single lead from sources such as
Realtor.com and Zillow, and instantly creates a new individual prospect
record. The second method, valet import, is for batch uploading of
multiple prospects. This process uploads an entire file of leads at
once, such as a list of FSBOs or expired listings that you have
identified through a lead service, information provided by a loan
officer, tax records, or even MLS records.

Another core function of real estate CRMs is **integration with
third-party services and products**. This might include integration with
your lockbox software, paid lead sources, your website, and MLS. A
generic CRM lacks these industry-specific integrations. In particular, a
real estate-specific CRM provides a wide range of options for
integrating real estate-specific lead sources.

Real estate CRMs will include built-in **real estate calculators**. You
can use the maximum loan and mortgage payment calculators to help a new
buyer estimate the home price they can afford before they have had a
chance to get pre-qualified by a loan officer. Similarly, the buyer’s
net calculator gives everyone a good idea of how much cash the buyer
will need to close a deal, including the down payment. You can use the
seller’s net calculator to give your client a good idea of how much
money they will be able to walk away with from the sale of their current
home. The rent-vs-own calculator can determine whether it makes
financial sense to own or rent. Market conditions change, and it is well
worth doing proper due diligence so your client is confident they are
making a sound financial move.

The **commissions tracking** features in a real estate CRM can give you
a clear understanding of your quarterly and annual net income. You can
also calculate potential commissions for deals in your pipeline to help
predict your cash flow. Your real estate CRM should also include an
**expense-tracking** feature that lets you monitor expenses, including
projected recurring costs such as MLS and licensing fees. You can export
both income and expenses when it is time to file your quarterly
estimated and annual taxes. These features help you stay compliant with
the IRS and track projected cash flow. Real estate is typically
seasonal, so you will want to compare last year’s results with this
year’s to understand trends and make sure you are on track.


> **The Monthly Mastery Secret**: Focus on learning one CRM skill each month to avoid being overwhelmed by the features. For example, you might try experimenting with eCards the first month, printing labels the next month, real estate calculators the third month, commission tracking after that, and so on.


For your buyers, you can track each buyer’s needs using a **buyers
database**. This database helps you record the **house features** and
property locations that interest your homebuyers. You can also **track
showings** and record your buyer's feedback for each property you see
with them. This is particularly helpful because after a few houses, they
all start blurring together for your client (and you!). You might have
shown them the perfect home first, but after ten more homes, they have
forgotten about that first one. When it comes time to make an offer, you
can track **offers**, deadlines, counteroffers, and even create a
closing record once the sales contract is ratified (the date all parties
have signed and the contract becomes official).

A real estate CRM also includes **transaction management** features that
help you track your listings, closings, promotions, and the parties
involved in each deal. You can also monitor contingencies (such as
inspection and financing conditions), conveyances, and escrow (the
buyer's deposit), or earnest money. Using transaction management along
with task plans helps you close deals more quickly and reduces legal
risks. Because the failure rate in real estate closings can be as high
as 20%, focusing on this part of the deal is just as vital as the other
stages.

While most real estate agents in the USA and Canada have access to an
MLS, some agents, particularly in other countries, do not. For those
agents, a database of homes or **properties** can be valuable. This
database contains properties in the market area. They might be for sale
or rent, and having a database of these properties allows an agent to
collect statistical information and match them against a buyer’s wants
and needs. While this feature is less useful for agents with MLS access,
it is a must-have for those without an MLS. The properties database is
also useful for commercial properties, which are often not on the MLS,
and for situations where the agent is working with off-market
properties.

An additional, underrated capability of your real estate CRM is the
ability to track your conversion statistics and which referral sources
are working and which are not. This helps you better understand how to
improve your marketing and prospecting. It can also help you make
long-term goals for how you intend to increase income year-over-year.

The technology that enables this comprehensive tracking is a
**relational database**. This means the database can associate or create
relationships between multiple records without duplication. That way,
you can efficiently work with a client on the sale of their existing
property as well as the purchase of a new property. As you start doing
deals involving the same person across multiple transactions, the
importance of a relational database becomes clearer. For example, if you
work with an investor who owns a portfolio of properties, they might
want you to handle multiple transactions, even simultaneously. The
relational nature of a real estate CRM allows you to handle this without
confusion. It also makes it possible to maintain archive records of past
deals with clients and to connect various parties with whom you might
work on more than one deal. You might work with a loan officer or a
closing company on multiple unrelated transactions, and the relational
database allows you to view the list of these transactions. A generic
CRM lacks these essential transaction management features, which is
another reason it is unsuitable for real estate agents.

You can also use the **lockbox database** in your real estate CRM to
track which lockboxes are installed for which properties, the shackle
code for each, and the unlock code. You can add special instructions,
such as the lockbox location, whether anyone is in the house during the
daytime, and any pets to be aware of.

## Repeatable CRM Systems

The most obvious benefit of using a real estate CRM is the ability to
organize consistent follow-up for your prospects and past clients. For
new prospects, most agents are great at the initial phone call but give
up too soon and do not follow up enough. Your real estate CRM lets you
build a consistent follow-up plan that could include a series of
time-release emails, multiple follow-up calls, follow-up text messages,
printed letters and postcards, and even a scheduled drive-by.

Your ability to contact a prospect across multiple communication
channels increases your chances of reaching them. This is particularly
critical when you have not yet received a response. For example, let’s
say you rely only on email, but your emails are being dumped into the
recipient’s spam folder and are never seen. Or perhaps the phone number
you have is an old landline, and this prospect is no longer at that
location and hasn’t heard your voicemails. This is why it is so useful
to use multiple communication modes, particularly when you have not yet
received a response. Your real estate CRM can be used to schedule these
communications and to add notes about what happened. For some forms of
communication, like time-release emails, your CRM can even automatically
send them.

For past clients and friends, you need to maintain your friendship, take
an interest in their lives, and ask about how things are going. The best
way to do that is by scheduling regular communications using tasks in
your real estate CRM. For physical Christmas cards, your real estate CRM
can print mailing labels. It can also remind you to contact your friend
on their Birthday and for the anniversary of the closing of their home.
You might even drop by in the spring with a packet of seeds to check on
the fantastic progress they have made in fixing up their backyard.


> **The Friends First Secret**: Avoid directly promoting your real estate business to friends, family, or past clients. Instead, focus on building authentic connections by showing an interest in their lives. This could mean celebrating milestones, chatting about sports, or discussing local news. They already know what you do; your best approach is to be the real estate professional they know will be on their side as their friend and trusted advisor.


Another benefit of using your real estate CRM is the ability to reuse
content. Agents need to send letters, create flyers, and communicate
with clients and prospects. In many cases, these communications are
nearly identical from one prospect or deal to the next. Using the
library of content built into your real estate CRM saves you time,
starting with high-quality material available for immediate use. You
can—and should—tweak these letters to meet your individual needs, and
the tweaked letters can then be reused. You can also use flyer templates
and reuse some of your ad copy from prior listings. The longer you use
your real estate CRM, the more you will be able to reuse your past work.
This saves you time over the long run.

One more key advantage of your CRM is the ability to create standard
operating procedures and checklists, also known as task lists. This
boosts productivity while maintaining a consistent level of quality.
Less-experienced agents will learn best practices by following the
standard checklists built into their real estate CRM. Experienced agents
can refine and personalize these checklists and letters to reflect their
unique approach to the real estate sales process.

The most obvious checklist is for a new listing. You will have a
standard list of promotional activities to complete, along with a
checklist of other tasks such as taking pictures, installing the lockbox
and yard sign, getting the listing agreement signed, updating Zillow,
and adding the listing to the MLS. This is the same approach even the
most experienced pilots use before flying to make sure they don’t forget
anything and don’t run into trouble mid-flight[9]. Use your checklist to
ensure you complete each task without missing anything.

These same checklists can also be used after closing to ensure you don’t
leave anything behind and to provide follow-up a few days after closing
and regularly thereafter to maintain a relationship with your past
clients. This last step is where most agents fail, and it is why many do
not maximize their referral income potential. Consistent follow-up turns
satisfied clients into repeat business and a valuable referral source.
All you need to do is maintain your friendship with past clients after
closing, and you have an excellent chance of getting repeat business and
perhaps even referrals.

When you handle one or two closings a year, you may not appreciate the
benefits of a checklist. However, as your business grows, a checklist
lets you focus on generating new business because the mechanical steps
of selling a home are systematized. Tracking everything in your real
estate CRM eliminates guesswork from the listing process.

Over time, you may find your income has increased enough to justify
delegation. This is usually when you realize there simply aren’t enough
hours in the day to complete all the tasks you need to do. Your best
approach is to focus on high-value tasks, such as prospecting and making
listing presentations, and delegate the checklist work to someone else,
such as an assistant or partner.

Your real estate CRM is the ideal tool for clarifying who does what and
tracking which tasks have been completed and by whom. That way, you can
oversee those tasks and focus on the higher-value activities needed to
grow your business. When it is time to hire an assistant, your CRM
provides a structured way to delegate tasks and hold your assistant
accountable. Your CRM allows you to control and coordinate far more than
would be possible with pen and paper. You should select a CRM that works
for a solo agent but can grow with you as you bring in a partner or
assistant.

Your real estate CRM can also provide continuity if you lose an
assistant and need to train a replacement. This is one area many agents
overlook when selecting their real estate CRM. Don’t underestimate the
time it takes to train a replacement assistant. Find a CRM vendor that
offers an easy-to-learn interface and complimentary training, not just
for you but also for your assistant and other team members.

## International CRM Use

There used to be two real estate CRMs headquartered in Canada: Top
Producer and iXact Contact. However, both companies faced financial
difficulties and were acquired by USA-based holding companies. At
present, there are no Canadian real estate CRMs. For the most part, the
real estate CRMs currently available are based in the United States.
However, these products can be adapted for Canada, Australia, and other
international markets with minor adjustments.

While your CRM content and letter library are likely geared toward use
in the United States, accommodations may have been made for other
languages and localities. The letters might also be available in
Spanish, which is useful since one in seven U.S. residents speaks
Spanish at home[10].

The Canadian market is 1/5 the size of the US market. For this reason,
the built-in content library may also serve that market. For example,
the eCard library could include content for holidays such as Canada Day
and Labour Day. Some library letters will be specific to the United
States, and that is by design. If a letter mentions special tax
considerations that apply only in the United States, it would be
excluded from drip sequences sent by a Canadian real estate agent. While
Canadians, Americans, and Australians all speak English, there are
variations in terminology and spelling that need to be accommodated. For
example, attorney is a common term in the United States, while lawyer is
a more general term used in both Canada and the United States. Your CRM
should make it easy to clone, edit, and tag these materials so you can
keep the correct version for the right audience and maintain brand
consistency.

All modern CRMs use UTF-8 to store text content, allowing text in
different languages to be mixed. Spanish can use accented characters,
and you can include Korean, Japanese, or Hebrew text alongside English
text. 

There are numerous preference settings you can adjust to personalize
your real estate CRM and align it with your locale. In the United
States, dates are listed month, day, then year, while in many other
locations the day and month are reversed. Your real estate CRM will
include a preference setting that lets you adjust this to your local
preference. The time display will be AM and PM by default, but you might
prefer twenty-four-hour time; that is a preference setting as well. The
unit of currency is also a consideration; you can select your preferred
unit, including the euro, pound, United States dollar, Canadian dollar,
or Australian dollar, among others. The unit of measurement for land in
the United States is often acres, but you can switch to metric units if
you prefer. The unit of area in the United States is square feet, but
you can also use metric units. Make these changes first, before you
import contacts or print anything, so every letter, flyer, and report
reflects the choices you made.

Another consideration for international real estate professionals is the
technical support hours offered by their CRM vendor. If the vendor is in
the United States and you are in Australia, the time zone difference
will make phone support difficult. International phone support is also
unlikely, as most United States-based real estate CRM vendors offer
phone support only to United States and Canadian customers. For this
reason, outside the USA and Canada, email support will likely be your
best option. Canadian customers can always ask technical support to call
them, eliminating toll charges for cross-border calls. Make sure to test
the vendor’s support to ensure it will work for you, given your time
zone.

The real estate calculators also include preference settings that can be
adjusted to match how your local market works. Commissions are
calculated slightly differently in Canada, using a graduated sales
commission. There are also nuances in how taxes are handled for
commissions and in how value-added tax is applied to expenses. In
Canada, mortgage interest is compounded semiannually rather than
monthly, as in the United States, so there is a preference setting for
that as well. The same goes for how you treat the tax deductibility of
both property taxes and mortgage interest. These items are
tax-deductible in the United States but are treated differently in
Canada. Your commissions will also need to account for the slightly
different tax reporting and withholding requirements in Canada.

There are slight differences in the regulatory requirements for sending
email and SMS. In Canada and the United States, these rules are similar.
Ask your CRM’s technical support team for specifics, as your market will
likely have unique needs. Your real estate CRM vendor will be aware of
the differences, so you can comply fully without running afoul of
regulations.

While the United States and Canada both use an MLS, there are markets
outside the United States where an MLS is not available. In these
situations, it helps to have a real estate CRM with a properties
database. A properties database is a collection of properties for sale
that provides functionality similar to your MLS, but at the local level.
With the properties database, you can record statistics about each
property for sale, such as square footage, room dimensions, and the
home’s unique features. This database is particularly helpful in small
markets, such as Caribbean islands, where the limited number of
properties makes creating an MLS impractical. Some agents also find the
properties database useful in unique markets, such as commercial real
estate or the New York downtown market, where local knowledge and
private inventory tracking matter as much as syndicated data feeds.

The real estate markets in the US and Canada are similar enough that the
same real estate-specific CRMs will work in both countries. Some areas,
like Australia and the Caribbean, are also quite similar. You will need
to conduct your own due diligence for areas outside these regions. Ask
your CRM vendor about support availability and whether their CRM is
suitable for your location.

## What to Look for in a CRM

The goal of using a CRM is to make your life easier and help you get
things done faster. For these reasons, I recommend you select a CRM that
is **easy to use**.

While recommendations from other agents in the office are one source of
information, keep in mind that each agent has their own work style and
needs. What works for one agent with a full-time assistant may not be
the right fit for a new agent. Look for a real estate CRM that offers a
**free trial**. Hands-on experience is the best way to decide which CRM
is right for you.

**Phone support** remains the gold standard for support. You will
inevitably encounter a problem you can’t resolve with the video
tutorials, and you don’t have time to wait for an email response. I
recommend selecting a CRM with phone support.

As a new Realtor, I recommend focusing on selecting an **affordable**
real estate CRM. The monthly cost should be closer to a restaurant meal
than a car payment. The functional differences between the two ends of
that spectrum are often not as vast as you might think, especially for
an agent just starting out.

Choose a vendor that provides **onboarding,** also known as a
**concierge setup.** Onboarding helps you import your data, synchronize
your contacts and calendar with your smartphone, create and install your
letterhead and signature, and receive initial training on how to use the
CRM. The sooner you start using your CRM effectively, the more likely
you are to keep using it. Therefore, selecting a CRM without the support
you need to get started is not helpful. If you're expected to do all
these tasks on your own, you might spend weeks or get stuck before
gaining any value from your CRM.

### MaiKai Makena 

Starting as a new real estate agent takes some capital investment up
front, but if you watch your budget, you can keep yourself afloat until
you’re profitable. MaiKai Makena, an agent in the Corona Del Mar
neighborhood of Newport Beach, CA, had this to say about starting out:
“As a new agent, there are so many costs to getting started in this
business, and when I looked at the pricing models of most CRMs, they
just seemed too expensive. It’s important that new agents know there are
affordable options out there, and starting with one of those can really
help.” He explains that finding cost-effective tools is only beneficial
if you learn to use them properly. As a new agent, you’ll have more time
than money, so it’s reasonable to save by buying an affordably priced
tool. But MaiKai Makena says that just because you want something
affordable doesn’t mean you should compromise on technical support.
“When I ran into questions, I reached out to my CRM support team and
always got the help I needed. Taking advantage of free support can save
you a lot of time and frustration as a new agent.” For Makena, success
in his first year came down to using tools he could afford to create
order in his chaotic new career. “What made the biggest difference for
me was having structure, keeping everything in one place so I wasn’t
losing track of clients, notes, or tasks.” One of the first things he
learned to do was import farming data and organize it as he wanted. He
also appreciated the ability to access information in his CRM while
outside the office.

You are likely to receive leads from various sources, including your
website, your broker’s website, Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com, and others.
Your real estate-specific CRM can automatically parse notification
emails from these sources and convert them into prospect records. This
feature, known as **email feed,** **lead forwarding**, **lead capture**,
or **email parsing**, saves you time by eliminating the need to manually
enter contact information for incoming leads.


> **Zap Trap Secret:** A good real estate CRM should include an email feed. Be cautious of vendors claiming similar features through Zapier. Zapier is a paid third-party service that connects various internet tools. Zapier adds costs and requires extensive setup for each lead source. In contrast, the email feed that comes with real estate-specific CRMs is pre-configured to parse hundreds of common lead sources like Zillow, IDX websites, Trulia, and Realtor.com, without extra charges.


A key feature for any real estate CRM is **mobile access**. Ensure that
your CRM's contacts and calendar **sync** with your smartphone's native
contacts and calendar. Also, verify that you can sign in and use your
CRM through a web browser on your smartphone and on a tablet, such as an
iPad.

## Things to avoid in a CRM

There is no perfect CRM. While price and features are easy to compare,
usability and customer support are not. When shopping for a real estate
CRM, the best thing you can do is take advantage of the free trial. **A
CRM that doesn’t offer a free trial is a red flag**. If a company isn’t
confident enough in its product to let you try it before paying, that
should tell you something. If the vendor requires a credit card to sign
up for the free trial, be aware that they will convert your free trial
to a paid membership unless you proactively cancel before it ends. The
best vendors will not resort to such underhanded practices.

Your brokerage or MLS might provide you with a “free” CRM. **Free CRMs
typically offer limited functionality.** Missing features might include
smartphone synchronization, phone support, printing, click-to-call, call
capture, real estate calculators, commission and income tracking, and a
content library. Using a CRM you control means that if you leave that
office and go to another brokerage, your disruption is minimized. Your
contacts database is preserved, and you do not have to learn a new
system.

Also, review the **privacy policy** of any free or broker-supplied CRM.
These vendors need to make a profit. Often, their privacy policies allow
them to harvest your CRM data for marketing. For example, the CRM vendor
might partner with a preferred mortgage broker, title company, and home
warranty provider, and use your database of listings and closings to
steer your clients toward these preferred services. It is best to work
with a CRM vendor that has strong privacy policies.


While you might initially think a free CRM is worth sacrificing your
privacy, consider this from your clients' perspective. If your clients
are steered toward a higher-interest-rate mortgage, you risk undermining
the trust you have built with them. You are a trusted advisor, and your
ability to provide impartial advice that benefits your clients is the
entire premise upon which you have been hired. By violating the privacy
of your data, you have shattered this trust.


> **Freedom has a Price Secret:** Beware of the “free” CRMs which your broker or MLS provides. These products often follow a “freemium” model, where the free version offers basic functionality with an expectation that users will eventually pay to upgrade. Since you did not select this product of your own free will, it may not be competitive. Many such systems are rarely updated and offer minimal technical support.


Not all CRMs are created equal. **Some CRMs are buggy, offer poor
support, or have predatory contract terms.** The best way to separate
the good from the bad (and the ugly) is to look at Google and Better
Business Bureau (BBB) reviews. These review sites are reasonably neutral
and can provide a good, unbiased view. Be wary of sites like Top5, G2,
and Capterra, which routinely pay for reviews and allow vendors to
suppress negative reviews.

You should **avoid using a generic CRM.** Real estate is a unique
business, and a generic CRM lacks many key features you will need. A
generic CRM is typically designed for corporate sales. In contrast, your
relationship with your clients is much more personal. That is reflected
in the information stored in the CRM, how letters and envelopes are
addressed, and even the reminders you receive, such as birthdays and
closing anniversaries.

**Avoid onboarding charges** by choosing a vendor that doesn't charge
for that essential service. These fees can add up quickly and are
charged before you get any value from your real estate CRM.

Some features seem like a good idea on paper but make no sense in
practice. Among these features are advanced multi-dialers, power
dialers, and SMS text message blast features. Lawsuits have made these
advanced features a legal minefield. Instead, I recommend sticking to
the legal and straightforward features of click-to-dial and SMS text
message chat.

An **integrated website** is another feature that might seem like a good
idea but is almost always a bad one. What happens if the website that is
included with your CRM is ineffective? What happens if the CRM that
comes with your website is not a good fit for you? In either case, you
must discard both to switch either, which can be tremendously
disruptive. Building a website takes years of effort and a lot of money
to gain a ranking in Google. Switching sites is not to be taken lightly.
Similarly, after investing a lot of time learning how to use your CRM,
you are not going to want to discard it just because the website is
inadequate. Instead, I recommend you select one vendor for your website
and a second vendor for your CRM. You can connect these two products
together using an email feed, allowing the flexibility necessary to make
changes over time.


Another area I advise you to avoid is a **generic monthly newsletter**.
Sending a pre-written, one-size-fits-all newsletter to everyone in your
database might seem like a great idea—until you read the content and
realize even your own mother is likely to opt out after the first
issue! The problem with a pre-made newsletter is that the content often
feels dull. Why? Because it’s designed not to offend anyone. It can’t
suggest that now is the best time to sell, since that could scare off
potential buyers. Plus, relying on ready-made content means it’s, by
definition, generic and doesn’t account for local market conditions.
Just like the weather, real estate is local. It’s not useful to hear
about the weather in New York City if you live in Kansas. The same goes
for real estate. I have seen some agent databases with opt-out rates
over 50% thanks to the generic monthly newsletter their CRM provides. By
enabling this one feature, they just cut their potential referral income
in half!

There is one type of newsletter that benefits everyone: a local real
estate market update sent once or twice a year. You are the expert on
real estate conditions in the neighborhoods you focus on. Why not share
that expertise with residents and those who might want to move in? They
can’t get that information anywhere else, at any price. The key to
making this work is writing the content yourself. Talk about properties
sold and for sale, along with local projects like a new school or mall.
Send this newsletter once or twice a year to residents and potential
buyers in the neighborhoods you serve. Just like hot sauce, a newsletter
is best in moderation.

**Over-automating** your processes is another common pitfall. Clients
pay a significant commission for your personal service. Features that
automatically respond to or nurture leads without your direct oversight
often fail. They send irrelevant information, sound robotic, or continue
communicating after a prospect has asked to stop. All of these will
ultimately damage your reputation with your clients and prospects. The
best automation supports your workflow while keeping you in control.
