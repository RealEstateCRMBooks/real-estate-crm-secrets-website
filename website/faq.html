Purchasing a real estate CRM will not automatically make you a better real estate agent, just as joining a health club will not automatically make you lose weight or become more fit.

            <p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong> While Scott is the creator of RealtyJuggler, the principles
              in these books are universal and apply to <em>any</em> real estate CRM. The focus is on the

        <h2 style="margin: 4rem 0 2rem; font-family: 'Merriweather', serif; text-align: center;">Insights from
          Real Estate CRM Secrets</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What is the best CRM for real estate agents?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>There is no single CRM that is perfect for every real estate agent. My best advice is to
              limit your selection to a CRM specifically designed for real estate. A generic CRM is just
              not going to be sufficient due to the significant differences between a real estate
              transaction and a typical B2B (Business-to-Business) transaction.</p>
            <p>Look for a real estate CRM that handles transactions, nurtures prospects, and maintains
              relationships with past clients. Since a real estate agent does not get paid unless the
              transaction is closed, your CRM should help you with the full lifecycle of the deal.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Are there really secrets to using a Real Estate CRM?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Certainly! The largest secret is the most obvious. Purchasing a real estate CRM will not
              automatically make you a better real estate agent, just as joining a health club will not
              automatically make you lose weight or become more fit. You need to use your real estate CRM
              regularly to gain the benefits. That is the single biggest secret to a real estate CRM:
              <strong>regular use</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>You should spend at least an hour a day using your real estate CRM. To do that, schedule time
              in your calendar for your "Office Hours"; this is the time you spend in your office working
              in your CRM, making outgoing phone calls, texting, printing letters, sending emails, and so
              on.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">I am a new agent. Should I copy a top agent to become successful?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>As a new agent, you have a lot to learn, and finding a mentor is a great idea. However,
              copying everything an experienced agent does may not always work. They have deep connections
              with past clients and a brand built over many years. They often focus more on listings than
              on buyers.</p>
            <p>You will first need to focus on meeting new people through activities like open houses, floor
              time, door-knocking, and cold-calling. Your real estate CRM can help you nurture the leads
              you already know, as well as those you just met.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Should I use the "free" CRM that my broker provides?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>While it might seem like a great idea, I recommend considering a few things first. Most
              agents switch brokers every few years, so make sure your contacts database is portable via
              export. If you run your own CRM, switching brokers requires no learning of a new system.</p>
            <p>Also, "free" options might lack key features or phone support. I recommend approaching any
              "free" CRM with skepticism. You only get paid if you close a deal, and if a free CRM holds
              you back, it's worth nothing to you.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Should I review the privacy policies of my CRM?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, you need to read your CRM's privacy policies carefully. Over the past few years, some
              real estate-specific CRMs have changed ownership, and new owners have shown interest in
              using your private data to market other services. In my books, I identify several real
              estate specific CRMs which protect the privacy of your personal data.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How can I make lead acquisition more predictable?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Most agents think their job is just helping clients buy and sell, but you are also selling
              yourself. A CRM can help you systematize the lead incubation process. While some prospects
              will fall into your lap, in many cases you will need to interact with them several times
              before they decide to work with you.</p>
            <p>By combining automation with the personal touch, you can reliably convert prospects into
              clients and take control of your destiny.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Why did you write the book Real Estate CRM Secrets?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>I wrote it because I felt most agents were not taking advantage of the full benefits of a
              CRM. Many agents switch to a different CRM each year in search of "perfection." This book is
              a guide to the actual benefits and the "why" behind specific features, serving as the
              missing manual for any real estate-specific CRM.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Who is Scott Schmitz, and why is he an expert?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Scott Schmitz is a founder of RealOrganized, Inc., the developer of the real estate CRM
              <strong>RealtyJuggler</strong>, which has been helping agents since 2004. With over 150,000
              users over the years, Scott has in-depth experience not just with his own software but with
              the industry as a whole.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What advice do you have for lead incubation?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Timeliness is critical. Prospects tend to select the last agent they spoke with. It is
              essential that you do not delay in calling and engaging with new prospects. You can use your
              CRM to track the last contact date and set reminders to contact people regularly.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Will a CRM send messages behind my back?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Automation is helpful, but you should always stay in the loop. I recommend reviewing content
              and approving when it's sent. Too much automation eliminates the human connection. Your CRM
              won't close the deal; you will, usually over the phone or in person. Automation is just a
              means to that personal interaction.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Should I use the CRM that comes with my website?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>I never recommend it. Tying your CRM and website together reduces your ability to switch one
              without the other. By using an independent CRM, you can fire your website vendor at any time
              if they don't produce results.</p>

          <h3 class="faq-question">How can I pick a CRM that is right for me?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Focus on practical tasks during the trial period. Make a list of three things you want to
              achieve (like building a unified database or tracking birthdays) and actually do them. Don't
              just get sucked into a slick sales presentation; make sure you can get things done on your
              own.</p>

          <h3 class="faq-question">What information should I put into my contacts database?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Enter each person's name and contact info, but also details about spouses, children, pets,
              and past conversations. Note common interests like sports or hobbies. This helps you
              maintain personal relationships with thousands of people by refreshing your memory before
              each contact.</p>

          <h3 class="faq-question">Are there any CRM features that are dangerous to use?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>A good CRM has guardrails for things like bulk emails and text message compliance. You want a
              vendor that helps maximize deliverability and keeps you compliant with legal requirements
              regarding permissions, so your messages don't end up in the spam folder.</p>
